# Project State: bookmark-dlp

## Current Status
- Initial analysis of index.js completed
- State file created
- Fixed Promise handling in main function
- Improved exec implementation to properly handle completion

## Project Summary
This project uses yt-dlp to download audio from YouTube videos listed in bookmarks.

## Analysis of index.js
The script does the following:
1. Imports necessary Node.js modules (child_process for executing commands, fs for file operations)
2. Defines a function to validate JSON strings
3. Implements a `yt_dlp` function that:
   - Takes a YouTube link as input
   - Uses yt-dlp to get video information in JSON format
   - Extracts the video title and sanitizes it for use as a filename
   - Identifies audio-only formats
   - Downloads the audio in mp3 format
4. Includes a `fetchYoutubeLinks` function that:
   - Reads from a bookmarks.html file
   - Extracts YouTube URLs from the bookmarks
5. Contains a `main` function that:
   - Currently uses a hardcoded array of YouTube links (instead of reading from bookmarks)
   - Downloads audio from one specific link (index 4)
   - Also attempts to download all links (but has a potential issue with Promise handling)

## Plans
1. Fix issues in the current implementation:
   - Correct the Promise handling in the main function
   - Ensure proper error handling
2. Enhance functionality:
   - Add progress tracking for downloads
   - Implement proper logging
   - Add option to use bookmarks.html instead of hardcoded links
3. Improve user experience:
   - Add command-line arguments for customization
   - Create better output formatting

## Learnings
- The script uses yt-dlp to extract audio from YouTube videos
- It currently has a hardcoded list of YouTube links rather than using the bookmarks.html parser
- Fixed Promise handling in the main function:
  - The original code used `forEach` which doesn't work properly with async functions
  - Changed to use `map` to create an array of promises
  - Used `Promise.allSettled` to properly wait for all downloads to complete
  - Added better logging of results
- Improved the `exec` implementation:
  - Added proper callback handling to resolve/reject the Promise only after the download completes
  - Added better error handling and logging
  - This ensures the Promise accurately represents the download status

## Next Steps
- Test the improved implementation with proper Promise handling
- Next: Implement the bookmarks.html parsing functionality
- Later: Add better error handling and logging throughout the application
